#### Important Files
```
RobotCode/src/Configuration.hpp  -> contains the motor and sensor port definitions and some other stuff
RobotCode/src/DriverControl.cpp  -> contains all the code for driving
RobotCode/src/Autons.hpp         -> code for writing the autons, should be easy enough to follow (don't forget to update the debug auton number in the implementation file
```
