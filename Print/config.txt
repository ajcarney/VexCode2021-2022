#contains rules for print order
#all files are printed alphabetically unless otherwise specified

#parent will specify which directory to start at. It should be set to where pictures are
parent = ../Pictures


#for rules: algorithm first finds all directories and sorts them according
#to rules. Directory rules starts with "dir" (can be in any order).

#Once all directories and their subdirectories are sorted, algorithm
#will look for individual files rules specifies with "file"

#formatting will look best as a directory tree
#only one rule per line

#order for print goes directory, files in that directory, subdirectory,
#files in the subdirectories of that parent


#set to "1" if user wants headers to be printed before implementation files
HEADERS_FIRST 1

#set to "1" if user only wants header files to be printed to save paper
#this will only keep implementation files that have no header
ONLY_HEADERS 0


#rules

#for rules involving headers and implementation files
#specify both the HPP and CPP file
#by setting HEADERS_FIRST the HPP file will be printed first
#even if the CPP file is listed first
